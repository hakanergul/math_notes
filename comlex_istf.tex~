We [can give ] gave an example of an $f:R\to R$ which is differentiable everywhere in $R$, but whose derivative $f'$ is not differentiable on $R$.
 In contrast, we will later learn that if $F:C\to C$ is a complex differentiable function in $C$, then it is infinitely many times complex differentiable!
