** Strategies for Research and Publishing **
********************************************
Analysis of the research literature in applied mathe-
matics reveals some common features that can be built
into a list of strategies for doing research.

(i) Solve an open problem or prove the truth or falsity
of a conjecture that has previously been stated in
the literature.
(ii) Derive a method for solving a problem that occurs
in practice and has not been effectively solved
previously. Problems of very large dimension, for
which existing techniques might be impractical,
are good hunting grounds.
(iii) Prove convergence of a method for which the
existing convergence theory is incomplete.
(iv) Spot some previously unnoticed phenomenon and
explain it.
(v) Generalize a result or algorithm to a wider class of
problems, obtaining new insight in doing so.
(vi) Provide a new derivation of an existing result or
algorithm that yields new insight.
(vii) Develop a new measure of cost or error for a prob-
lem and then derive a new algorithm that is better
than existing algorithms with respect to that met-
ric. For example, instead of measuring computa-
tional cost in the traditional way by the number
of elementary arithmetic operations, also include
the cost of data movement when the algorithm is
implemented on a parallel computer.
(viii) Find hidden assumptions in an existing method
and remove them. For example, it may seem obvi-
ous that multiplying two 2 ร 2 matrices requires
eight multiplications, but Strassen showed that
only seven multiplications are needed (see [I.4 ยง4]
for the relevant formulas), thereby deriving an
asymptotically fast method for matrix multiplica-
tion.
(ix) Rehabilitate an out-of-favor method by showing
that it can be made competitive again by exploit-
ing new research results, problem requirements,
or hardware developments.
(x) Use mathematical models to gain new insight into
complex physical processes.
(xi) Use mathematical models to make quantitative
predictions about physical phenomena that can
lead to new procedures, standards, etc., in the tar-
get field. Here it will probably be necessary to work
with researchers from other disciplines.
