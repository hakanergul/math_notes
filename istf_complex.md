We [can give ] gave an example of an $f:R\to R$ which is differentiable everywhere in $R$, but whose derivative $f'$ is not differentiable on $R$.
 In contrast, we will later learn that if $F:C\to C$ is a complex differentiable function in $C$, then it is infinitely many times complex differentiable! Clearly this is an unexpected result if all we are used to is real analysis. We will later learn that the reason this miracle takes place in complex analysis is that complex differentiability imposes some "rigidity" on the function which enables this phenomenon to occur. We will also see that this rigidity is a consequence of the special geometric meaning of multiplication of complex numbers.
